Under the directory where all your projects are located:
	Run "ng new ex2" to generate the Angular application
Under ex2 directory:
	Run "npm install" to reinstall the dependencies for the project, this must be done e.g. if the contents of `node_modules` directory got deleted for some reason.
	Run "ng serve" for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
	Run "ng generate component component-name" to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
	Run "ng build" to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
